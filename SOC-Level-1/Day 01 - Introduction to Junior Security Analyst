Day 01 – Introduction to Junior Security Analyst (SOC Level 1)

##Objective
Understand the role of a Junior SOC Analyst (L1), how SOC fits into the Blue Team, and learn the basics of alert triage, investigation, reporting, and escalation through a hands-on phishing investigation.

Role: Junior Security Analyst (SOC L1)
Core Responsibilities
- Monitor security alerts generated by SIEM and security tools
- Perform initial alert triage and investigation
- Identify whether alerts are True Positive or False Positive
- Escalate incidents to SOC L2, Incident Response, or Security Engineers when required
- Document findings clearly and accurately
- Communicate with SOC team members (L2 analysts, SOC Manager, Security Engineers)

##Alert Triage – Fundamentals

What is Alert Triage?
The process of reviewing, prioritizing, and investigating alerts based on severity and potential impact.

Alert Severity Levels
- Low
- Medium
- High
- Critical
Severity helps decide urgency and escalation path.

Alert Triage Process

If a Playbook Exists
- Follow the predefined steps
- Validate alert logic
- Collect required evidence

If a Playbook Does NOT Exist

Identify what is under attack:
Host
User
Network
Cloud resource

Identify attack type:
Malware
Phishing
Brute-force / failed login attempts

Analyze surrounding activity:
Events before the alert
Events after the alert
Lateral or related activity
Hands-on Investigation Summary
Alert Classification
Analyze logs
Assign severity based on urgency

Investigate to determine:
True Positive
False Positive

Example Investigation Indicators
Source IP and destination host
User account involved
Commands executed
MITRE ATT&CK techniques (e.g., data exfiltration)
Example: More than 5GB of data sent externally indicates possible data exfiltration

##Alert Reporting – 5W Method

Every SOC report should answer the 5W questions:
Who – Which user executed commands or accessed resources
What – What malicious or suspicious action occurred
When – Start and end time of the activity
Where – Affected host, device, IP address
Why – Analyst reasoning and justification for the verdict
Clear reporting is essential for escalation and incident response.

##Spike of Domain Discovery Commands

Timeline of Events
19:56

Host: DMZ-MSEXCHANGE-2013
OS: Windows Server 2012 R2
User: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

Commands Executed
cmd.exe
dir
hostname
whoami /priv – Enumerate privileges
net group "Domain Admins" /domain – Identify high-privilege users
nltest /dclist:tryhackme.thm – Enumerate Domain Controllers

Analyst Assessment
These commands indicate Active Directory reconnaissance, a common post-compromise behavior aimed at privilege escalation and domain control.

Verdict & Escalation
Activity suggests potential compromise and reconnaissance
Classified as True Positive
Escalated to SOC L2 for deeper analysis and response

Effective SOC work requires strong documentation, escalation, and communication skills.
