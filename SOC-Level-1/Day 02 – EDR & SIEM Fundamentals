#Ojective
Understand the role of EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) in SOC operations, how alerts are generated, analyzed, and used by SOC analysts for detection, investigation, and response.

#Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)
Why EDR is Needed
-Traditional antivirus provides surface-level protection
-Antivirus mainly works on signature-based detection
-Modern attacks often bypass signatures
-EDR provides deep visibility into endpoint behavior and activities.

#EDR Capabilities (SOC Perspective)
-Detects malicious activity on endpoint devices
-Generates alerts with severity (Low, Medium, High)
-Enables automatic response (blocking known malicious activity)
-Allows manual response by SOC analysts
-Supports investigation and threat hunting

#EDR Telemetry & Architecture

Endpoints run EDR agents

Agents collect:
-Process execution
-Network activity
-File modifications
-Registry changes

Data is sent to a centralized EDR console. This data is known as telemetry

The EDR console:
-Analyzes telemetry
-Assigns severity
-Generates alerts for SOC analysts
-False Positives in EDR (Behavioral detection may generate false positives)

#SOC analysts must:
-Validate alerts
-Identify true vs false positives
-Take appropriate action

#Practical EDR Scenario

Attack Flow Example:
-Phishing email delivers malicious script
-Script executes via PowerShell
-PowerShell downloads additional payload
-Attacker gains remote access

#EDR Visibility:
-Captures full execution chain
-Shows parent-child processes
-Logs network connections
-Records file downloads and execution
-This visibility is critical for incident analysis.


##Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)##

Why SIEM is Required
Organizations generate logs from multiple sources:
-Linux servers
-Windows servers
-Firewalls
-Web servers
-Network devices

Analyzing logs individually is inefficient and ineffective.
SIEM centralizes, correlates, and analyzes logs to detect threats.

#Log Collection in SIEM
Logs collected via:
-Lightweight agents
-APIs
-Syslog
-Manual ingestion

Sources generate logs in different formats, making correlation difficult without SIEM.

#Parsing & Normalization
-Parsing: Breaking raw logs into structured fields
-Normalization: Converting logs into a consistent format

This enables efficient searching and correlation across sources.

#Log Correlation (Key SIEM Function)
Individual logs often lack context.
Correlation Example:

Web server log – website access

Network log – access from unknown IP

System log – PowerShell execution

Correlation across multiple sources reveals malicious activity patterns.

#Host-Centric vs Network-Centric Logs

Host-Centric Logs:
-File execution
-PowerShell activity
-Process creation
-Application logs

Network-Centric Logs:
-SSH connections
-VPN access
-Firewall traffic
-Router communication

Both perspectives are essential for accurate detection.

#Detection & Response in SIEM
Rule-Based Detection
SIEM uses predefined detection rules

SOC analysts can create custom rules

Example Rule:
windows.exe AND event_id = 104 → REMOVE
Rules help detect suspicious or malicious activity.

Key Learnings
-EDR provides deep endpoint visibility
-SIEM centralizes and correlates security logs
-SOC analysts rely on both tools for detection
-Alert validation and tuning are critical SOC skills
-Effective SOC work depends on context, correlation, and documentation
